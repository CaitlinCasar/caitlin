Hello! Today I want to share a quick tutorial on how to use a green screen in <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html?sdid=KKQOM&amp;mv=search&amp;kw=test&amp;ef_id=CjwKCAiAjp6BBhAIEiwAkO9Wuio80LqbtnaqDCEclArcjpHpSpbm5vfJjf8NyvEIU3mf2OReKuOx9RoCUt4QAvD_BwE:G:s&amp;s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!469198202114!e!!g!!adobe%20premiere%20pro&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAjp6BBhAIEiwAkO9Wuio80LqbtnaqDCEclArcjpHpSpbm5vfJjf8NyvEIU3mf2OReKuOx9RoCUt4QAvD_BwE" target="_blank">Adobe Premiere Pro</a>! Premiere Pro is a video editor in the Adobe Creative Cloud suite thatâ€™s got a ton of great features that make movie making a breeze! I wanted to try out using a green screen because Iâ€™m working on a video of my PhD defense. Due to COVID I canâ€™t defend in person, so I thought Iâ€™d try to have some fun with special effects! First Iâ€™ll go through the equipment I used and then Iâ€™ll show you how to replace your green screen background in Adobe.

<h2>Green Screen</h2>
<p>
This is a green screen I bought on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08KDFXBXK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" target="_blank">Amazon</a>. I chose this green screen because I wanted to be able to use it anywhere in my apartment, sitting or standing.

The dimensions are 5â€™x7â€™ and you can hang it either landscape or portrait orientation on a telescoping tripod. The tripod height is adjustable and easy to set up.

The other thing I love about this green screen is that you can fold it up so it doesnâ€™t take up much space. Itâ€™s double-sided with green on one side and blue on the other, and itâ€™s very lightweight.

<h2>Ring Light</h2>
<p>I also bought this ring light on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08CM3B44L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" target="_blank">Amazon</a> because the green screen works best when your background has no shadows. The ring light is on a telescoping tripod so the height is adjustable and can be used sitting or standing.</p>

<p>The ring light has controls for three different light colors from cool to warm and brightness levels. Thereâ€™s also a bluetooth controller that you can use for the shutter on your phone camera if you want to take selfies!</p>
