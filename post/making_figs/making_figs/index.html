<p>This is the first of several tutorials I’m putting together for making figures that are common in microbial ecology. Today we’ll start with an interactive bar plot for exploring your microbial community data. For this tutorial I’m using data and code from my publication in Geobiology. You can fork the repo by clicking the button above!</p>
<p>To generate the data, we sequenced DNA from microbial communities at our study site DeMMO. The raw sequence data was processed with QIIME to produce an OTU table. OTUs, or operational taxonomic units, are bins that differentiate sequences at a 97% similarity threshold. For our purposes, you can think of an OTU as a species of bacteria or archaea. As a microbial ecologist, you might want to compare your microbial communities in terms of alpha or beta diversity. Let’s make some plots to explore our microbial communities!</p>
<p>Before we get started, you’ll need to set up your environment in R. This code depends on the packages being loaded here:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#load libraries 
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, plotly, randomcoloR)</code></pre>
<p>Next, read the OTU data into a dataframe. We can pull the data directy from Github by reading the raw file. You can preview the data in the table below this code chunk.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#read the data into a dataframe
otu_table &lt;- read_delim(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CaitlinCasar/Casar2020_DeMMO_MineralHostedBiofilms/master/orig_data/DeMMO136_Dec2015toApril2018_noChimera_otuTable_withTaxa_d10000.txt&quot;, delim=&quot;\t&quot;, comment = &quot;# &quot;)
metadata &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CaitlinCasar/Casar2020_DeMMO_MineralHostedBiofilms/master/orig_data/metadata.csv&quot;) 

#store the taxonomy for each OTU
taxonomy &lt;- otu_table %&gt;%
  select(`#OTU ID`, taxonomy) %&gt;%
  mutate(tax = gsub(&quot;Gammaproteobacteria; D_3__Betaproteobacteriales&quot;, &quot;Betaproteobacteria; D_3__Betaproteobacteriales&quot;, taxonomy), #fix taxonomy for Beta&#39;s,
         taxonomy = str_remove_all(tax, &quot;D_0__| D_1__| D_2__| D_3__| D_4__| D_5__| D_6__&quot;)) %&gt;%
  separate(taxonomy ,sep=&#39;;&#39;,c(&quot;domain&quot;, &quot;phylum&quot;, &quot;class&quot;, &quot;order&quot;, &quot;family&quot;, &quot;genus&quot;, &quot;species&quot;)) %&gt;%
  gather(level, taxonomy, domain:species)</code></pre>

<p>We want to look at the community compositions, so first let’s normalize and reshape the data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>abundance_table &lt;- otu_table %&gt;%
  select(-taxonomy) %&gt;%
  mutate_at(vars(-`#OTU ID`), funs(./sum(.)*100)) %&gt;% #normalize to relative abundance 
  gather(sample_id, abundance, `7.DeMMO1.Steri.050917`:`18.800.DitchFluid.041818`) </code></pre>
<div id="htmlwidget-2" style="width:100%;height:400px;" class="widgetframe html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-2">{"x":{"url":"/post/making_figs_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_unnamed-chunk-5.html","options":{"xdomain":"*","allowfullscreen":false,"lazyload":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<p>For plotting purposes, let’s pick a subset of samples.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>barplot_samples &lt;- c(&quot;12.DeMMO1.steri.041818&quot;,

<p>Now, let’s take a look at the phylum level abundances for each sample.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>taxon_abundance_table &lt;- abundance_table %&gt;%
  left_join(taxonomy) %&gt;%
  filter(sample_id %in% barplot_samples &amp; level == &quot;phylum&quot;) %&gt;%
  mutate(taxonomy = if_else(is.na(taxonomy), &quot;Unassigned&quot;, taxonomy))</code></pre>
<p>Let’s make a custom color palette for our phyla.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>phylum_color &lt;- distinctColorPalette(k = length(unique(taxon_abundance_table$taxonomy)))
names(phylum_color) &lt;- unique(taxon_abundance_table$taxonomy)</code></pre>
<p>And now, let’s create a stacked bar plot for each site.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bar_plot &lt;- taxon_abundance_table %&gt;%
  left_join(metadata) %&gt;%
  group_by(site, experiment.type, taxonomy) %&gt;%
  summarise(abundance = sum(abundance)) %&gt;%
  ungroup() %&gt;%
  mutate(experiment.type = factor(experiment.type, levels = c(&quot;fluid&quot;, &quot;inert.control&quot;, &quot;pyrolusite&quot;, &quot;pyrite&quot;,&quot;hematite&quot;,&quot;magnetite&quot;,&quot;siderite&quot;,&quot;gypsum&quot;,&quot;muscovite&quot;,&quot;calcite&quot;))) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(fill=taxonomy, y=abundance, x=experiment.type)) +
  geom_bar(stat=&#39;identity&#39;, position=&#39;fill&#39;) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=phylum_color) +
  coord_flip() + 
  theme(axis.title = element_blank(),
        legend.title = ggplot2::element_blank(), 
        legend.text = ggplot2::element_text(size = 8),
        legend.key.size = unit(0.5, &quot;cm&quot;)) +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(site), switch = &quot;y&quot;) + 
  guides(fill = guide_legend(ncol = 1))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Joining, by = &quot;sample_id&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Finally, let’s make it easier to explore our data with an html version of our bar plot!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplotly(bar_plot)</code></pre>
