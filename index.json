Using in situ geochemical data, you can model the Gibbs free energy available from metabolic reactions and predict which metabolisms are energetically favorable! Gibbs free energy can be modeled using the following equation: \\[\\Delta G_r - RT ln \\frac{K_r}{Q_r }\\]\n where \\(\\Delta G_r\\) is the Gibbs energy of reaction r under in situ conditions, \\(K_r\\) and \\(Q_r\\) are the equillibrium constant and activity product of the rth reaction, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin.  \\(Q_r\\) can be calculated using the following equation: \\[Q_r = \\prod a_i ^{v_{i,r}}\\]  where \\(a_i\\) is the activity of the ith species and \\(v_{i,r}\\) is the stoichiometric coefficient of the ith species in the rth reaction.  For this tutorial I’m using data and code from my publication in Geobiology. We calculated activity coefficients for each species of interest using Spece8 in Geochemist’s Workbench using geochemical data collected from our field site. Then we used the CHNOSZ package to calculate Gibbs free energy of various metabolic reactions. First, let’s check out what the activity data looks like. #load tidyverse library pacman::p_load(tidyverse) activities \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CaitlinCasar/Casar2020_DeMMO_MineralHostedBiofilms/master/orig_data/DeMMO_SpecE8_aqueousGas.csv\u0026quot;)  {\"x\":{\"url\":\"/post/thermodynamic_modeling/index_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_unnamed-chunk-2.html\",\"options\":{\"xdomain\":\"*\",\"allowfullscreen\":false,\"lazyload\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}  You can see we calculated activites for Ca2+, acetate, CH4, Fe2+, H+, HCO3-, HS-, Mn2+, NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, and SO42- at six different sites called DeMMO1-6.  Once you have your activity coefficients, then you need to decide what reactions you want to model. I was interested in metabolic reactions with minerals, so I created a spreadsheet of balanced reactions with minerals and aqueous species available in situ. Let’s load this data and preview it here. #import DeMMO mineral reactions reactions \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CaitlinCasar/Casar2020_DeMMO_MineralHostedBiofilms/master/orig_data/reactions_aq_gas.csv\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% filter(!product.f == \u0026quot;manganite\u0026quot;) #removing reactions with manganite because we don\u0026#39;t have equation of state data for this   {\"x\":{\"url\":\"/post/thermodynamic_modeling/index_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_unnamed-chunk-4.html\",\"options\":{\"xdomain\":\"*\",\"allowfullscreen\":false,\"lazyload\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}  The formatting of this data is important for compatability with CHNOSZ, so make sure you include the details I’m showing here when you balance your reactions. Notice that the reactant stoichiometric coefficients are negative because they’re on the left side of the reaction, while products are positive because they’re on the right side of the reaction. Now we’re ready to model Gibbs free energy from these reactions in CHNOSZ! First we’ll load the CHNOSZ library. #load the CHNOSZ library pacman::p_load(CHNOSZ) Let’s take a look at the available species for modeling reactions in the CHNOSZ database:\nthermo_db \u0026lt;- thermo()$obigt %\u0026gt;% as_tibble()  {\"x\":{\"url\":\"/post/thermodynamic_modeling/index_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_unnamed-chunk-7.html\",\"options\":{\"xdomain\":\"*\",\"allowfullscreen\":false,\"lazyload\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} A few minerals that I was interested in were missing in the database, but that’s ok! If you have the Gibbs free energy available at stadard conditions and the equation of state data for your reactant, you can add it to the CHNOSZ database. Let’s add pyrolusite and ferrihydrite with the mod.obigt function!\n#add pyrolusite to database pyrolusite \u0026lt;- mod.obigt(\u0026quot;pyrolusite\u0026quot;, G=-111100, H=-124283, S=12.61, V=17.3, formula=\u0026quot;MnO2\u0026quot;, state=\u0026quot;cr\u0026quot;, a1.a=12.55, a2.b=9.761, a3.c=-2.105) #add ferrihydrite to database ferrihydrite \u0026lt;-

values on the right, this is standard for this kind of data labs(x=expression(Delta~G[r]~\u0026#39;kJ/mol\u0026#39;~e^{textstyle(\u0026quot;-\u0026quot;)})) + #generate the axis labels ylab(\u0026quot;Reaction #\u0026quot;) + geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype=\u0026quot;dotted\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) + #add a vertical line at zero for reference theme(legend.position = c(.1, .6), legend.text=element_text(size=8), legend.title = element_text(size=8, face=\u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;)) + #position the legend on the left theme(legend.key.size = unit(0.2, \u0026quot;in\u0026quot;)) #resize the legend to make it fit  Everything that plots to the right of the dotted line is exergonic, while everything to the left of the dotted line is endergonic. The most exergonic and therefore the most energetically favorable reactions occur with the mineral pyrolusite, followed by pyrite.

My contrubution to this effort is creating a space for sharing relevant content and discussion on the web. In addition to creating the site, I want to empower the NU EPS community to contribute to the blog through this tutorial. If you’re not a member of the NU EPS community, this tutorial can help you create your own site and get familiar with the basic functions in Git!\nGetting started with Git and Github The first thing we need to do is get set up to collaborate on Github. If you’re not familiar with Github, it’s a Git repository hosting service that also provides version control and collaboration features. Git is the version control system that tracks changes in your files and makes it easy to update your repository on Github. If this doesn’t make sense now, that’s ok! Once you see Git and Github in action it should be clear why we’re using it.\n Install Git   Next, create an account on Github. If you set up a student account, you’ll have access to private repositories (i.e. if you need to backup unpublished data or code) - I highly recommend this!   Now, you’ll need to set your credentials in Git. Open up your Mac terminal or gitbash on PC, then use the git config commands to configure your username and email. This will ensure that you have the ability to modify repositories on Github.   #set your user name on github git config --global user.name \u0026quot;John Doe\u0026quot; #set your user email on github git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com  Now, clone the repo I created for the NU Earth Grads site by typing this into your terminal or gitbash:   git clone https://github.com/NUEarthGrads/blogdown  The top four commands you’ll need to use git are status, add, commit, and push. Here’s an example of how to use these - we’ll come back to this in a bit.   #check the status of your local repo git status #add all new untracked files to the queue git add . #commit your changes and add a short description git commit -a -m \u0026quot;short description here\u0026quot; #push your changes to the repo on the Github server git push   Blogdown To create the site, I used a package in R called Blogdown. This is a great package that makes it really easy to create and update your site using R markdown. If you’re using RStudio with blogdown, you can serve the site locally and preview it right in your RStudio viewer window. It’s super easy to customize your CSS (cascading style sheet) - this is an easy way to change the styling of HTML elements across your site, such as font styles or colors. Blogdown integrates Hugo, a static site generator that has tons of awesome themes ready to go! For this site, I chose the Hugo Academic theme. I’ll walk you through the basics of blogdown, then show you how to create a new blog post!\n Install R and Rstudio   Install the blogdown package. You can do this in RStudio by entering the following in the console window in RStudio:   install.packages(\u0026quot;blogdown\u0026quot;)  To use Hugo in blogdown, install Hugo:   blogdown::install_hugo()  To generate the Hugo academic theme template site, run the following line in your RStudio console. Note Do not do this if you are updating the NU Earth Grads site, only do this to create a brand new site!   blogdown::new_site(theme = \u0026#39;gcushen/hugo-academic\u0026#39;)  To preview your site in the Viewer window, you can either select “Serve site” from the Addins dropdown menu in RStudio, or run the following in your console:   blogdown::serve_site()  When you are ready to build your site to HTML format for web hosting, run the following in your console:   blogdown::hugo_build(local=T) Check out your Files window in RStudio. You should see a list of files and directories similar to this:\nThe content folder contains the markdown files used to build the site. The public folder contains the files generated by the hugo_build function.\n If you want version control of the code used to generate your site, you can create a Github repo by running the following in your terminal:   #change directories to the blodgown directory you created. For example, if you have a directory called \u0026quot;blogdown_site\u0026quot; on your desktop: cd ~/Desktop/blogdown_site #initialize a git repository in the directory git init #add all the files to the queue git add . #commit the changes and add a short message git commit -a -m \u0026quot;init commit\u0026quot;  Now you have a local repository. In order to host that repo on Github, go to github.com and create a new repository by clicking the green “new” button in the top right. Don’t initialize a README file. Give your repo a name, for example “my_website”. Then click “Create repository” at the bottom.  In your terminal, run the following: #push your repo to the Github server - note that \u0026#39;username\u0026#39; should be replaced with your Github username and \u0026#39;my_website\u0026#39; should be replaced with the name of the repo you created on Github. git remote add origin https://github.com/username/my_website git push -u origin master  If you created a brand new site and want to host it online, I recommend hosting it on Github Pages - it’s free!    First you’ll need to create a new repo named username.github.io. Don’t initialize it with a README file. To create the NU EPS site, I created a repo using the organization name NUEarthGrads on Github called NUEarthGrads.github.io. You can see this repo here.    Next, initialize a repo in your public folder in your blogdown directory and push the repo to your github.io repo:    #change directories into your public folder - this is where the site builds to when you run blogdown::hugo_build(local=T) cd ~/Desktop/blogdown_site/public #initialize a git repository in the directory git init #add all the files to the queue git add . #commit the changes and add a short message git commit -a -m \u0026quot;init commit\u0026quot; #push your repo to the github server git remote add origin https://github.com/username/username.github.io git push -u origin master  To view your site, go to https://username.github.io/ in your web browser.  Create a new post  We’re finally ready to create a new post! If you cloned the NUEarthGrads repo, open that folder and double click on the blogdown.Rproj file to open the project in RStudio.  Run the following in your RStudio console: #run the blogdown new_post function to generate a new markdown file in the post directory with today\u0026#39;s date blogdown::new_post(title = \u0026quot;my blog post title\u0026quot;, subdir=\u0026quot;post/my_blog_post_directory\u0026quot;, date = \u0026quot;June 9 2020\u0026quot;)  The Hugo academic theme will add an image next to your post on the home page. To do this, add the image you want to be associated with your post inside the new directory you just created - in this example the directory is called “my_blog_post_directory”. Name the image “featured”, as in “featured.jpg”. Then, rename your new markdown file “index”, as in “index.Rmd”.  Open up the markdown file you just created. You can do this from RStudio by navigating to the file in the Files window pane via the following path: content \u0026gt;\u0026gt; post \u0026gt;\u0026gt;my_blog_post_directory. Then double click on the markdown file.  You should see something like this:  Here’s an exaple of how to modify the header: --- title: my blog post title author: ~ date: June 9 2020 slug: June 9 2020-my blog post title categories: [\u0026quot;Diversity\u0026quot;] #add categories for your post inside the brackets tags: [\u0026quot;#BLM\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;equity\u0026quot;] #add tags inside the brackets subtitle: \u0026#39;This is my post!\u0026#39; summary: \u0026#39;Some info here about this post...This is what will be displayed on the home page.\u0026#39; authors: [Caitlin] #add your name inside these brackets to indicate who authored the post lastmod: \u0026#39;2020-06-09T15:36:45-05:00\u0026#39; featured: no image: caption: \u0026#39;\u0026#39; focal_point: \u0026#39;\u0026#39; preview_only: no projects: [] ---  Now you’re ready to add content to your post.

Today we’ll create an interactive NMDS plot for exploring your microbial community data. NMDS, or Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling, is a method for dimensionality reduction. This works great for high demensional datasets like microbial communities and makes it visually easy to compare lots of communities to each other. We’re using NMDS rather than PCA (principle coordinates analysis) because this method can accomodate the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity distance metric, which is better suited for our community data than Euclidean distance.

An inherent difficulty in studying subsurface biofilms is that of sample acquisition. While samples from marine and terrestrial deep subsurface fluids have revealed abundant and diverse microbial life, limited work has described the corresponding biofilms on rock fracture and pore space surfaces. The recently established Deep Mine Microbial Observatory (DeMMO) is a long‐term monitoring network at which we can explore the ecological role of biofilms in fluid‐filled fractures to depths of 1.5 km. We carried out in situ cultivation experiments with single minerals representative of DeMMO host rock to explore the ecological drivers of biodiversity and biomass in biofilm communities in the continental subsurface. Coupling cell densities to thermodynamic models of putative metabolic reactions with minerals suggests a metabolic relationship between biofilms and the minerals they colonize. Our findings indicate that minerals can significantly enhance biofilm cell densities and promote selective colonization by taxa putatively capable of extracellular electron transfer. In turn, minerals can drive significant differences in biodiversity between fluid and biofilm communities. Given our findings at DeMMO, we suggest that host rock mineralogy is an important ecological driver in deep continental biospheres.","tags":["Geobiology","Astrobiology","Biofilms"],"title":"Mineral‐hosted biofilm communities in the continental deep subsurface, Deep Mine Microbial Observatory, SD, USA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Osburn, M.

Subsurface microbial dynamics can only be understood in the context of accompanying geochemistry, and thus, it is imperative to first characterize available microbial habitats and their temporal evolution. Also, samples must be acquired in a clean and consistent manner to avoid artifacts stemming from surface microbes, atmospheric contamination, or external temporal variability. To facilitate these ends, we established the Deep Mine Microbial Observatory (DeMMO) in the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), Lead, SD, USA to sample naturally draining fracture fluids at six spatially distributed sites from the shallowest (800 ft) to the deepest accessible (4,850 ft) depths. Here we report on the installation and subsequent two-year aqueous geochemical monitoring campaign of the DeMMO network. DeMMO fluids have distinct geochemical compositions showing differences with respect to depth, proximity to mine workings, and host rock geology. Most measurements were remarkably stable through the two-year sampling window, illustrating temporal stability of the water sources to each site, including over induced perturbations such as drilling. Interestingly, there was a lack of seasonality even at shallowest sites, indicating limited direct communication with modern meteoric waters. Patterns of fluid geochemistry are distinct between sites, and largely predictable based upon our understanding of the lithology and inorganic geochemistry of the host rocks. Thermodynamic calculations suggest that both inorganic and organic redox reactions can yield energy to, respectively, lithotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms in this system, although the yields vary considerably by site. We conclude that each DeMMO site represents a unique window into the deep subsurface of SURF, accessing distinct fluid pockets, aqueous geochemistry, and dissolved gas geochemistry – providing stable conditions that facilitate long-term habitation of subsurface fractures and water pockets by distinct microbial communities.","tags":["Geobiology","Astrobiology","Geochemistry"],"title":"Establishment of the Deep Mine Microbial Observatory (DeMMO), South Dakota, USA, a Geochemically Stable Portal Into the Deep Subsurface","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Academic  Academic | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click  PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

Passive or active microbially mediated iron transformations at alkaline conditions in deep biosphere serpentinizing ecosystems are understudied. We explore these processes in the Zambales (Philippines) and Coast Range (CA, USA) ophiolites, and associated surface ecosystems by probing the relevance of samples acquired at the surface to in situ, subsurface ecosystems, and the nature of microbe-mineral associations in the subsurface. In this pilot study, we use microcosm experiments and batch culturing directed at iron redox transformations to confirm thermodynamically based predictions that iron transformations may be important in subsurface serpentinizing ecosystems. Biofilms formed on rock cores from the Zambales ophiolite on surface and in-pit associations, confirming that organisms from serpentinizing systems can form biofilms in subsurface environments. Analysis by XPS and FTIR confirmed that enrichment culturing utilizing ferric iron growth substrates produced reduced, magnetic solids containing siderite, spinels, and FeO minerals. Microcosms and enrichment cultures supported organisms whose near relatives participate in iron redox transformations. Further, a potential 'principal' microbial community common to solid samples in serpentinizing systems was identified. These results indicate collectively that iron redox transformations should be more thoroughly and universally considered when assessing the function of terrestrial subsurface ecosystems driven by serpentinization.","tags":["CROMO","Geobiology","Biofilms"],"title":"Biofilm Formation and Potential for Iron Cycling in Serpentinization-Influenced Groundwater of the Zambales and Coast Range Ophiolites","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
